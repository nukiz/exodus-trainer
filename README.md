# Exodus Trainer - Intended multihack for Growtopia, but didn't finish.. :D

## Features
- Modules (Antibounce, modfly, antiban etc)
- Spammer (fully customizable from delay to message and message length, works also in discord minecraft etc.)
- Exodus Dev Console (super wip)

### Details
- Trainer uses Memory.dll to read/write memory changes in Growtopia, and Spammer uses the C# function SendKeys();. Spammer is unstable and using it may result in it continuously spamming and leaving you unable to use any functions in your pc, other than shortcuts. If this happens, restarting your PC fixes the issue.

## Licensing
You may use this as a base for any trainer, although you have to credit nukiz and/or ZyphHax somewhere visible in your trainer or where it is distributed. You may not use this base as a way of getting profit in any monetary way, and you may not advertise this as something you've fully coded.
